# Day 12 solution

https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/12

### Part 1

Brute forcing a solution where I distribute the amount of dots between runs of # to all possible combinations. From those, save the ones which satisfy the basic constraint of separating every run of # by at least one dot. Go through these combinations and pattern check them against the input string. Not very efficient, gets the answer in about 40 seconds...

### Part 2

Not brute-forcable, too many combinations. I'll maybe try this later.

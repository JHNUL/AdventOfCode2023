# Advent of Code 2023 submission repo

### Language
Python

### Instructions
Use venv to isolate dependencies `source .venv/bin/activate`.

### Motivation
Purely for my own learning and refreshing on data structures and algorithms. No codegolf, no emphasis on language-specific tricks for terseness. Absolutely no AI usage. I try to include some drawings and explanations to record thoughts and ideas about the solutions.

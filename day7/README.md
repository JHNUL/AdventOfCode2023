### Part 1

I decided to go with a custom class for Hand consisting of cards and a bid and implemented a custom sorting method that puts the cards in their correct order based on the criteria given. It works and is fast, but the code is somewhat messy.

### Part 2

Small modifications to the sorting logic as jokers can promote hands to higher strength.
